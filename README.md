# Election_Analysis

## Audit Overview
Tom and Steve, representatives of the Colorado Board of Elections, requested assistance to accumulate results of a recent congressional election. After gathering results to display the total number of votes cast, including total votes for each candidate, we were also able to qauntify these as percentages for each candidate and determine a winner of the election by popular vote. 

## Election Data Resources
Utilizing the [election_results](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv) data set within Python 3.8 along with Visual Studio Code 1.60 we were able to consolidate these requested results as shown below.

## Summary of Election Analysis
Using our raw data set, we were able to identify our total number of votes of 369,711. We grew off of this finding to further our analysis and determine all of the candidates involved, as well as their total votes received and what percentage of total votes they received in this election. Once we identified all this data we were able to conclude our over all election winner, based on popular vote.
